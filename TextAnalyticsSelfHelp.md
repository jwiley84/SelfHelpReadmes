# I need help on Bot Framework SDK (Bot Development)\Cognitive - Text Analytics

The Text Analytics API is a cloud-based service that provides advanced natural language processing over raw text, and includes four main functions: sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language detection, and entity recognition.

The API is a part of Azure Cognitive Services, a collection of machine learning and AI algorithms in the cloud for your development projects.

There are (as of 2020) NO SAMPLES on how to integrate TA with the bot framework.
